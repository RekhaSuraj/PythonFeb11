# While loop : Iteration return till condition is True, then iteration will be stop
# while Condition:
#     Statement ...1


# while False:
#     print('Inside While loop, it will stop when condition becomes False')

# print('Outside of While loop')
# # Outside of While loop

# In simple words, The while loop enables the Python program to repeat a set of operations while a particular condition is true.
# When the condition becomes false, execution comes out of the loop immediately, 
# and the first statement after the while loop is executed.
