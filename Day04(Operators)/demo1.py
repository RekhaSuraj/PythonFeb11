# Operators are special symbols for performing operations on operands
# var1 = var2 + var3
# var2 is operand1
# var3 is operand2

# In Python there are 6 types of operators
# 1. Arithmetic operators
# 2. Assignment operators
# 3. Logical operators
# 4. Comparison operators (Relational operators)
# 5. Membership operators

# Modulus(%)
# Exponentiation (**)

# Addition 
a1 = 10
a2 = 20
a3 = a1+a2
print(a3)
# 30

n1 = -5
n2 = -10
n3 = n1+n2
print(n3)
# -15
