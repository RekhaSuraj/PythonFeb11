# Interface vs Abstract class Vs Concrete class :
# 1.If we don't know anything about implementation, then just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.(SRS, Service Requirement Specification)
#
# 2.If we are talking about implementation but not completely then we should go for abstract class (partially implementd class)
#
# 3.We are talk about implementation completely and ready to provide service then we should go for concrete class(Fully completed class).
