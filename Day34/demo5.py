# 3. We can import specific functions from a file by giving "from <file_name> import <function_name>"
# 4. We can import all functions from a file by giving "from <file_name> import *"
# 5. We can rename a module by giving "import <file_name> as <new_name>"("as" keyword should be used for renaming)
