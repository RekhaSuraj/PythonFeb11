# Protected members are those members of the class that cannot be accessed
# outside the class but can be accessed from within the class and its subclasses.
# To accomplish this in Python, just follow the convention by prefixing the name of the member by
# a single underscore ‚Äú_‚Äù.
# By convention, it means:
# üîπ "This is meant for internal use only. Please don't access it outside the class or subclass."
# üîπ But technically, Python still allows access ‚Äî it's just a warning to developers.
