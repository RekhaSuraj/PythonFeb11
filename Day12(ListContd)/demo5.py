# Tuple : Tuple is a Built-in datatype in python
# It is used to store multiple values with in a single unit to Assign to a variable name
# Tuple denoted by round braces / Paranthesis  ( )
# Tuples are immutable - Meaning once a tuple is created, we cannot modify the elements in it

# There are two ways to create a tuple
# Type : 1  using the Paranthesis
t1 = (10,20,30,40)
print(type(t1))
# <class 'tuple'>

print(t1)
# (10, 20, 30, 40)

# Type2: using the constructor
t2 = tuple((11,12,13,'a','b'))
print(t2)

# list
lis1 = [102,20]
li1 = list((10,20,20))
print(li1)

# tuple
tupll1 = (10,203)
t1 = tuple((10,22,33))
print(t1)

# empty tuple creation
t2 = tuple()
print(t2)
# ()
print(type(t2))
# <class 'tuple'>
